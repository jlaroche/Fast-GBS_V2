# **Fast-GBS.v2: An Analysis Tool Set for Genotyping-by-Sequencing data**



## Introduction

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a rapid, flexible, low cost and robust genome-wide scanning method of multiplexed samples for large-scale molecular marker discovery and genotyping. These characteristics make GBS an excellent tool for many applications and research questions from conservation to functional genomics in both model non-model species with complex genomes or limited available resources. Continued improvement of GBS relies on a more comprehensive understanding of data analysis, missing data imputation challenges and an active after-development support. Here, we present Fast-GBS.v2, a comprehensive analysis tool set for GBS data analysis and missing data imputation.
